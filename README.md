Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
answer= Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to the development of high quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
answer= 1) Development of programming languages; this is a formal set of rules and symbols used to write instructions that a computer can understand and implement.  these establishes standards for writing codes which promotes consistency among developers and systems.
2) Advent of structured programming; is a programming model that emphasizes the use of structured control flow construct to improve quality and clarity of software.  implementation of this across programming languages promoted the portability of code and its concepts.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer= 1) Requirements; this is the gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements.
2)Design; creation of high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3)Implementation; the writing of codes and building of the software according to the design specifiations.
4)Testing; This involves conducting various teststo ensure the software meets quality standards and functionality requirements.
5)Deployment; This the releasing of the software to the users.
6)Maintenance; Providing ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer= Both waterfall and agile methodologies are approachees to project management.
Waterfall Methodology involves sequential phases,rigid structure and extensive planning.
Example is seen in a physical product such as a car, whereby the design,manufacturing and testing stages must be completed in a strict sequence.  WHILE
Agile methodology is iterative,flexible and adaptable to changes.
Example is seen in software development projects where customer feedback is common. therewfore agile allows frequent adjustments to ensure the product meets current market needs. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer= 1)software developer; is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2)Quality Assurance Engineer;ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3)Project Manager;oversees the planning,excution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer= 1) IDEs are software tools that provide comprehensive tools for the writing,debugging and testing of codes. 
they offer advanced code editors with code completion and error checkingwhich help developers write code more efficiently.
example include; intelliJ IDEA for java development.
2) VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work amongteam members.
They offer VCS helps keep detailed history of every change made to the database,including who made the change and when it was made. which enables developers to track the evolution of the project.
Example include; Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer= 1) Tight deadlines= Prioritise tasks based on timeline and importance,with tools like pomodro technique to maintain focus and productivity.
2)changing requirements
3)technical debt
Other strategies include ;improving communication with team and stakeholders and problem solving approach to break down complex problems into smaller and manageable parts.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
answer=
1)Unit testing is the testing of individual unit of a software applicationin isolation from the rest of the system.
importance=it catches bugs early in the development cycle.
2)Integration Testing is the testing of interactions between  integrated units,ensuring that the combined units work together correctly as a module.
Importance= it detects interface issues and ensures that components integrates seamlessly.
3)System Testing;is the evaluation of the complete integrated software product as a wwhole.
Importance; it tests performance ,security and reliability aspects and acceses overall system readiness for deployment.
4)Acceptance testing; is the user acceptance testing performed to determine if a system satisfies user requuirements.
Importance=it validates that the software is user friendly and meets regulatory requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.
Importance=it helps to make questions clear and specific so that the AI understands exactly what the user needs,to avoid getting a confusing answer.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt= what are the roles of an engineer?
Improved prompt= What are the roles of a chemical engineer in an oil refinery?
The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows the description down to the type of engineer and the type of working environment. so to say, it is specific and concise.
